 I am a veteran nerd from an island that enjoys working with cyber security tech. I recently earned the Google Cyber Security Certification, and I am now working on achieving the Security + Certification. I am self taught with SQL and Python with certificates to show basic knowledge. 
 You'll find a number of my projects here, some being a work in progress. I am looking to gain experience, and learn as much as possible! I can't wait to see where this road leads! 

Skills: SQL/Python/Linux/ Vulnerability assessment/nmap/ wireshark/ Nessus
